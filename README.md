# Insurance-Charges-Predictor

## Data Pre-processing
We use the dataset provided which has 6 variables about a person i.e. age, gender, region, bmi, smoker (yes/no) and number of children. It then has the insurance charges for all these of these people. We convert string data into integral data giving it values such as binary in case of smoker/gender and on base 4 in case of region for example.s

## Using Linear Regression
We then split the data and use 20% of it to train our Linear Regression and then use the 80% of the remaining data to test our results.
